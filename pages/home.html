      Hello everyone! This is Abdul Raheem. I have over 7 years of IT experience all in QA. My journey started with a manual tester role then as automation tester, then as a Test Lead, then as a Test Manager now.
      But there was a spark that I got while I was automating websites using Selenium.. How the websites are built?? This led me to spend some time on the internet.
      Honestly, Developing was more intersting, fun and challenging than actually testing it.

      My mind started to align towards changing the career path to a developer than just a tester. Hold on! There are people who are gonna shout at me that "Hey, testing career isn't bad. We have automation?"
      Yes, I agree. But an Automation Engineer, in the essence, is a developer who writes a code to run the test.
      Is it too late as I was already 7 years into IT industry? But we have always seen some success stories on the internet. Didn't we? I back backed up myself with the the saying, "Better late than never".
      Afterall we are in an agile world. So that does mean the resources should be agile too. So basically you should be regarded as just as a Software Engineer. Develop when you have a requirement to Develop,
      Test when you have a requirement to Test.. and so on. In simple terms, be flexible enough to stay ahead.
