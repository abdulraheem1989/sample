  <h4>My Journey to a Front End Developer!</h4>
  <section>
    Hello everyone! This is Abdul Raheem. I have a story to tell you all. About my Journey from QA to a Front End Developer.
    <br> I have over 7 years of IT experience. My educational background is actually EEE. We had some papers in computer science
     like C, C++ and Data structures. Though not greatly interested, I managed to clear those exams. Post my graduation, getting a job
      in the field of my degree was so frustrating as unfortunately I couldn't get an offer on campus placements. With a weak financial
      backgroud of my family pressurizing, I was ready to any sort of job.
      <br>
      My career started with a manual tester role then as automation tester, then as a Test Lead,
     then as a Test Manager now. I have come accross HP UFT and Selenium in my testing. Selenium was more interesting as you have to
     query the DOM with the selectors. That is the point where I got some interest in learning web development. This curiosity  led me to spend
      some time on the internet during my leisure hours. Developing was more intersting, fun and challenging than actually testing it.

    My mind started to align towards changing the career path to a developer from QA. Hold on! There there was this cliche everywhere, "Hey,
    you are already 7 years into testing career, nobody will hire you as developer. Go and learn automation. It has good scope". But, I had
    this strong feeling in my mind. We are in agile world. So that does mean the resources should be agile too. So basically you should be
    regarded as just as a Software Engineer. Develop when you have a requirement to Develop, Test when you have a requirement to Test, and so on.
    In simple terms, be flexible enough to stay ahead.
    <br>
    Then comes the mind voice again, Is it too late as I was already 7 years into IT industry?
    <br>.
    <br>.

    <br>.
    <br>.
    Are you on same path like me? getting this same thought?
    <br>.
    <br>.
    <br>.
    <br>.
    <br>.
    <br>.
    Remember these two old lines.
    <br>.

    <br>.
    BETTER LATE THAN NEVER..........PERSEVERENCE PAYS.
