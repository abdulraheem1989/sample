  <h4>My Journey to a Front End Developer!</h4>
  <section>
    Hello everyone! This is Abdul Raheem. I have a story to tell you all. About my Journey from QA to a Front End Developer.
    <br> I have over 7 years of IT experience. My educational background is actually EEE. We had some papers in computer science
     like C, C++ and Data structures. Though not greatly interested, I managed to clear those exams. Post my graduation, getting a job
      in the field of my degree was so frustrating as unfortunately I couldn't get an offer on campus placements. With a weak financial
      backgroud of my family pressurizing, I was ready to any sort of job.
      <br>
      My career started with a manual tester role then as automation tester, then as a Test Lead,
     then as a Test Manager now. I have come accross only HP ALM and HP UFT. Selenium was my interest but my work did not allow open source.
     But, trust me, Selenium was more interesting than the UFT. It showed me some glimpses of what is under the hood in a web app.
     This curiosity  led me to spend some time on the internet during my leisure hours. So easy right?? No. It is easily said.
     Web development has too much ground to cover. There are millions of videos and tutorials available on the net. I was wondering where
     would I start. If you are not organized, you are screwed. As usual, it started with the <pre>"Hello World"</pre> in the plain HTML.

    My mind started to align towards changing the career path to a developer from QA. Hold on! There there was this cliche everywhere, "Hey,
    you are already 7 years into testing career, nobody will hire you as developer. Go and learn automation. It has good scope". But, I had
    this strong feeling in my mind. We are in agile world. So that does mean the resources should be agile too. So basically you should be
    regarded as just as a Software Engineer. Develop when you have a requirement to Develop, Test when you have a requirement to Test, and so on.
    In simple terms, be flexible enough to stay ahead.
    <br>
    I ended up spending 1 hr a day for almost an year. Then finally decided "lets jump over to a UI developer role". As mentioned earlier, it was
    too difficult to appear in interview with the amount of experience I had. Almost 5 weeks later, I got an opportunity as UI developer.

    Then comes the mind voice again, Is it too late as I was already 7 years into IT industry?
